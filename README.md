# Introduction

These two small projects were developed as a compliment to [The Complete Python Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/16112769#overview) course I've recently finished. The jpg to png converter was a course project that I've made a few tweaks to improve and make it more readable after reading the documentation and the gif resizer was just a personal project to experiment and test a bit more of the library.

# Requirements

Python3, pip and  Pillow are required, for convenience a requirements.txt file is provided in the config, to use it run the following command:

# Usage

For the jpg to png conversion all you have to do is supply the original images path and the target images path:

<p align="center">
    <img width="640" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dumiii/image-processing/master/images/jpg_png_convert.png" alt="JPG to PNG Instructions">
</p>

For the gif resizer, assuming the gif is in the same directory as the script:

<p align="center">
    <img width="640" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dumiii/image-processing/master/images/gif_resizer.png" alt="Gif Resizer Instructions">
</p>

<br />

The result is saved under the name **new.gif**
