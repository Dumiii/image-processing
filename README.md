# Introduction

These two small projects were developed as a compliment to [The Complete Python Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/16112769#overview) course I've recently finished. The jpg to png converter was a course project that I've made a few tweaks to improve and make it more readable after reading the documentation and the gif resizer was just a personal project to experiment and test a bit more of the library.

# Requirements

Python3, pip and  Pillow are required, for convenience a requirements.txt file is provided in the config, to use it run the following command:

For the gif resizer, assuming the gif is in the same directory as the script:

<br />

The result is saved under the name **new.gif**
